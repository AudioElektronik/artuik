TUIK provides many useful data about construction industry and residential
home sales. These data are not in a clean format and requires some pre
processing before it can be used for our internal reporting. This package 
is written for that purpose. It is not a complete solution for all TUIK's data 
but only for the ones we are interested in at Audio Elektronik.

Install it like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("AudioElektronik/artuik")
````
