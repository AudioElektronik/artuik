#' Cleaning town population data from TUIK
#'
#' The process of obtaining raw data is explained in
#' \code{inst/extdata/README.md}. This function takes that raw data and makes
#' it tidy data.
#'
#' Data generated from here is later put into \code{data} folder by
#' \code{devtools::use_data()}
#'
#' @param file_path path of the town population raw data
