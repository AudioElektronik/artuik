TUIK provides many useful data about construction industry and residential home sales. These data are not in a clean format and requires some pre processing before it can be used for our internal reporting. This package is written for that purpose. It is not a complete solution for all TUIK's data but only for the ones we are interested in at Audio Elektronik.

Install it like this:

``` r
devtools::install_github("AudioElektronik/artuik")
```
